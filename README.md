# Testing of Wireless Turn Indicators for Automotive Applications
Created as a capstone project for Robert S. and Peter L.


This project was mostly done as a proof-of-concept, but was eventually completed as a capstone project. 

The final copy of the code was stored on the university's private GIT server.
